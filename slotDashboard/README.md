The goal of this is two have 2 parallel routes that each have their own error loading and stuff.
Also going to switch to bun for this for the first time.

Modal are interesitn in the fact that each one has it's own routing. Like when I was do the itnercepting route modal. I made the modal only show when you are the url /batman. Which was pretty interesting. This means switchign for one page to another you can only chaneg the page but also the modal spefcifcially
