Followed Jeff's video but added my own twist of making an actual api instead of just using pocketbase and tried to use tailwind where I can.
For api_route I did the classic api route with api endpoints which is the same in both page and app router.
For server_actions I tried to not use the api route and instead do all the backend in the same section like php lol.
